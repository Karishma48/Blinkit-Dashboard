# Blinkit-Dashboard


Hello everyone, I hope all is well with you!

I’m thrilled to share some exciting news—introducing my latest project, the Blinkit Dashboard, created with the powerful Power BI tool. As we know 

This dashboard is a treasure trove of insights into our sales performance, highlighting key metrics like Total Sales, Avg Sales, No. of Items, and Average Rating. To make the data come alive, I’ve used a variety of charts:

Matrix Chart: Features a Pie Chart showing Fat Content, and a Bar Chart illustrating Fat by Outlet and Item Types, all connected through a slicer for easy filtering.
Line Chart: Depicts the timeline of Outlet Establishment.
Donut Chart: Displays Outlet Size distribution.
Funnel Chart: Highlights the geographic distribution of Outlets.
In addition, I created a comprehensive Table that visualizes Total Sales, No. of Items, Avg Sales, Avg Rating, and Item Visibility.

This project started with data sourced from GitHub, followed by a meticulous process of cleaning, organizing, and performing operations that make a real impact. The inclusion of slicers adds an extra layer of interactivity, making the dashboard even more user-friendly.

The final result is a visually appealing and informative dashboard with well-thought-out charts. Check it out and let me know your thoughts!
